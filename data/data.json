  "introduction": "I am a Research Scientist at CSIRO's <a href=\"https://research.csiro.au/data61/\">Data61 </a> in the Distributed Sensing Systems group. In my research, I am broadly interested in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). This includes Intelligent and Multi-modal Sensing Systems, Internet of Things (IoT) and Embedded Intelligence. Check past and ongoing projects. </br> Prior to the current position, I was a postdoc in CSIRO's <a href=\"https://research.csiro.au/mlai-fsp/\"> Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence Future Science Platform</a>. I obtained my PhD in Computer Science from the <a href=\"https://www.unsw.edu.au/\">University of New South Wales in Sydney</a> under the main supervision of Prof. <a href=\"https://research.unsw.edu.au/people/professor-wen-hu\">Wen Hu</a>.My PhD background is in Radio-based Sensing (<i>example past works include <a href=\"https://youtu.be/t28NXk9XABE\">RFWash </a> and <a href=\"https://youtu.be/LSMYWO0k3VY\">WiRelax </a></i>)\n  ",
